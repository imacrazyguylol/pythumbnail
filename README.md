# pythumbnail

Generates thumbnail images for maryland osu (and hopefully later on, other osu scoreposting channels)

# TODO (yeah lotsa stuff):
- use osrparse to generate thumbnails from replay

- generate config.json upon first user installation
- user input API stuff; client secret/key

### NOT HAPPENING FOR A WHILE
- create working ui
- parse .psd files to use as template :scp:
