# pythumbnail

Generates thumbnail images for maryland osu (and hopefully later on, other osu scoreposting channels)

# TODO (yeah lotsa stuff):
- Compile to windows


### NOT HAPPENING FOR A WHILE
- create working ui
- parse .psd files to use as template :scp:


The .spec files are not necessary for runtime dw about them
