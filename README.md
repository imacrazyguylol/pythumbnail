# IMPORTANT!
### Fair warning to anyone trying to use this right now: 
As far as I know, the exe doesn't work right now. I had a friend test it and there were some issues with libraries not compiling to the windows exe properly, which I unfortunately have no time to fix right now. It's absolutely on my radar though, as soon as my schedule allows. 
Also, it currently can't do any specfic changes to the style or formatting outside of what is hard-coded, among some other user unfriendly aspects of it.
However, if at your disposal, the linux executable should work. Please submit a pull request or DM me on discord if you experience any other issues not mentioned, or you DON'T experience any of the issues I HAVE mentioned. The latter is more intriguing.



# pythumbnail

Generates thumbnail images for maryland osu (and hopefully later on, other osu scoreposting channels)

# TODO (yeah lotsa stuff):
- Compile to windows


### NOT HAPPENING FOR A WHILE
- create working ui
- parse .psd files to use as template :scp:


The .spec files are not necessary for runtime dw about them
